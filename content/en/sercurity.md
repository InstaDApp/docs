The security of the DSA platform is an important norm for us. We have taken several steps to mitigate the potential threats, in order to build a more robust base layer, which will further ensure the safety and reliability of the overall DeFi ecosystem.

We encourage the community to go through our smart contracts, as they are completely open-source. The DeFi Smart Account codebase is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/InstaDApp/dsa-contracts).

### Audits

The DSA has been reviewed and audited by [Samsunz](https://samczsun.com/) and [Peckshield](https://peckshield.com/en).

1. [Samsunz - March 2020](https://samczsun.com/instadapp-audit-loa)
2. [Peckshield - March 2020](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/InstaDApp_audit_report_2020_04_en_1_0.pdf)

We understand the importance of security and will continue to carry out more security audits as we continue to add more connectors.
